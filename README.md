My work for UCLA's CS111 (Operating Systems Principles) in Fall Quarter 2023: [https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs111/](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs111/)

| Assignment  | Grade | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Lab 0 | 100 |
| Lab 1 | 99 | Late penalty
| Lab 2 | 39 | was stupid and looked at incorrect output for test cases given on piazza (went by someone's response who had incorrect test case output and wrote my code to fit that)
| Lab 3 | 92.86 | grading for this lab was a literal mess and depended on what time your code was tested on the SEASnet servers (i got super lucky)
| Lab 4  | 100 |
| Report | 100  |
